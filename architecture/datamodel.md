# Bookit Data model

## Cloud Data model

The book it app data model is based on a NoSQL approach leveraging cloud firestore. Cloud firestore organizes data based on 2 primary concepts:

- Documents: A document is a lightweight record that contains fields, which map to values. Each document is identified by a name.
- Collections: Documents live in collections, which are simply containers for documents.

Refer to the [Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/data-model) for more details on how information is structured and organized within firestore.
